# Getting started with the MXCHIP AZ3166 IoT DevKit

**Total completion time**:  30 minutes

In this tutorial you use Azure RTOS to connect the MXCHIP AZ3166 IoT DevKit (hereafter, the MXChip DevKit) to Azure IoT. The article is part of the series [Getting started with Azure RTOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2129824). The series introduces device developers to Azure RTOS, and shows how to connect several device evaluation kits to Azure IoT.

You will complete the following tasks:

* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming the MXChip DevKit in C
* Build an image and flash it onto the MXCHIP DevKit
* Use Azure IoT Central to create cloud components, view properties, view device telemetry, and call direct commands

## Prerequisites

* A PC running Microsoft Windows 10
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Hardware

    > * The [MXCHIP AZ3166 IoT DevKit](https://aka.ms/iot-devkit) (MXCHIP DevKit)
    > * Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz
    > * USB 2.0 A male to Micro USB male cable

## Prepare the development environment

To set up your development environment, first you clone a GitHub repo that contains all the assets you need for the tutorial. Then you install a set of programming tools.

### Clone the repo for the tutorial

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. If you previously cloned this repo in another tutorial, you don't need to do it again.

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started.git
```

### Install the tools

The cloned repo contains a setup script that installs and configures the required tools. If you installed these tools in another tutorial in the getting started guide, you don't need to do it again.

> Note: The setup script installs the following tools:
> * [CMake](https://cmake.org): Build
> * [ARM GCC](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm): Compile
> * [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm): Monitor serial port output for connected devices

To install the tools:

1. From File Explorer, navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named *get-toolchain.bat*:

    > *getting-started\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. After the installation, open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the tutorial. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following code to confirm that CMake version 3.14 or later is installed.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    ```

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`WIFI_SSID` |{*Your Wi-Fi ssid*}|
    |`WIFI_PASSWORD` |{*Your Wi-Fi password*}|
    |`WIFI_MODE` |{*One of the enumerated Wi-Fi mode values in the file*}|

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`IOT_DPS_ID_SCOPE` |{*Your ID scope value*}|
    |`IOT_DPS_REGISTRATION_ID` |{*Your Device ID value*}|
    |`IOT_DEVICE_SAS_KEY` |{*Your Primary key value*}|

1. Save and close the file.

### Build the image

In your console or in File Explorer, run the script *rebuild.bat* at the following path to build the image:

> *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\tools\rebuild.bat*

After the build completes, confirm that the binary file was created in the following path:

> *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\build\app\mxchip_azure_iot.bin*

### Flash the image

1. On the MXCHIP DevKit, locate the **Reset** button, and the Micro USB port. You use these components in the following steps. Both are highlighted in the following picture:
